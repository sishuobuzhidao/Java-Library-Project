3.Library Management System
Build a system to manage a library’s book inventory. 
Implement functionality to add new books, check out books, and return books.

books.txt should have one empty line for further addition of books.
Any borrowed book will be stored in the form "name=borrower"
Just do not add any "=" in the book name or borrower name

Author note: I wrote two versions of the system.
The ConsoleApp class is a console version of the library, where Scanners and while loops implemented.
The LibraryFrame class is used to describe the GUI version of the library, along with four other classes ended with "Frame"
A test class can create an object of LibraryFrame to start the program.
